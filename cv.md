My goal is the working with interesting projects on position Senior Developer or Team Lead!<br>
I'm working in web development from the time of CSS2 (about 2010). Basically in frontend development (HTML/CSS).<br>
I love and want to develop beautiful and useful interfaces. Since 2017 I worked a little in backend development too.<br>
I like to learn new technologies. And I'm always pay much attention to details.
